# wedding

Hi, you've found Sage and Sonya's over-engineered wedding website. Built using
Vue.js and deployed on Firebase for reasons beyond all comprehension.

Site should be up at https://sageandsonya.net, please feel to create an issue
here if something looks wrong. Screenshots are appreciated! Website built for
desktop, good luck if you're on your phone.
