    <h3>WHERE TO STAY</h3>
    <p>
      If you want to stay right on site, we've booked a block of 10 rooms at the
      Endicott House itself, and 10 in the adjacent Brooks Center. To book, use
      <a href="https://mitendicotthouse.org/?p=15279">this link</a> with the
      password "LP Wedding" (note, there is a space between those words). Please
      let us know if you're interested!
    </p>
    <p>
      You're also welcome to stay anywhere else in Boston! We're still figuring
      out the story on shuttles to/from Endicott House, check back later. For
      reference, the Endicott House is about a 25 minute drive from South
      Station, and there are a number of hotels in Dedham itself, about a 5-10
      minute drive away.
